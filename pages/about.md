This blog is to link you to other blogs which I enjoy to broaden your horizons about books and publishing . I will also comment on books which I enjoy, I won't be reviewing books per-say but more focusing on my favorites and why I love them because I recognize how subjective tastes in books can be.

This file is an example of a page in Jekyll, that automatically shows up in the header navigation, you can delete or modify this file freely.

This file is saved inside the _pages_ folder and is saved as _about.md_ . Any file in this folder (as long as it has  the YAML header) will automatically show up as a link in the header bar.

You should use **markdown**to write this text and this will automatically be converted to `HTML`.
