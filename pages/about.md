This blog is to link you to other blogs which I enjoy to broaden your horizons about books and publishing . I will also comment on books which I enjoy, I won't be reviewing books per-say but more focusing on my favorites and why I love them because I recognize how subjective tastes in books can be.

I am a master's publishing student and am all about the inside scoop and connecting readers to what is happening behind the scenes in publishing houses to prove the value of publishers in creating the glorious books readers enjoy.
